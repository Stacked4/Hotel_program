# Upon further experimentation I decided to leave this program as is. Very simple, reserve a room, delete room (cancel reservatioon),even look 
# at availability of rooms, and even try to lookup somone (bu their name) to see where that person is at. Now I know in real life the front 
# desk wouldn't reveal that information.
